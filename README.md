Question 2
List five significant features of React

1. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
2. Virtual DOM
3. Extensions
4. Conditional statements
5. Components

Question 3
List five major advantages of React

1. It allows writing custom components
2. It is simple.
3. It is Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.
4. It guarantees stable code.
5. It is backed by a strong community.

Question 4
What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?
Answer - React was created by Jordan Walker and React is owned by FaceBook.

Question 5
What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

1. In HTML almost all tags have an opening and a closing tag except probably a few like <br/> while in JSX, any element can be written as a self-closing tag, for example: <div/>
2. In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly. You can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
3. In JSX we use className attribute whereas in HTML we use the class attribute. This is because JSX is transpiled into JavaScript and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.
4. Event listeners in JSX are written in camelCase, for instance, onClick whereas in HTML, they are written in lowercase for instance, onclick.

Question 6
Why can’t browsers read JSX?
Answer - React uses JSX that allows us to write JavaScript objects inside the HTML elements. JSX is neither a string nor HTML. It is a syntax extension of JavaScript. JSX makes code easy and understandable. Browsers can’t read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
